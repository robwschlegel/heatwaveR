-   Updated SST data to end of 2022
-   Changed behaviour of `lolli_plot()` and `event_line()` to now use tidyeval
  -   Note that this is a backwards compatibility breaking change that was required due to changes in **`ggplot2 v3.0.0`**

# heatwaveR 0.4.6.9002 (2023-01-09)

-   Updated citations page for all references to `heatwaveR` from 2022
-   Added package names to all functions used in the downloading OISST vignette
-   Added the `MCSice` argument to `category()`, which allows users to directly classify a MCS with a threshold below -1.7Â°C as a category 'V Ice' event _sensu_ Schlegel et al. (2021; Marine cold-spells)

-   Updated the MCS colour palette throughout the package
    - The new colour palette is very similar, but with improved contrast
-   Made a minor but important change to `category()` so that categories are based on temperature greater (lesser) than the thresholds and not greater (lesser) than or equal to

# heatwaveR 0.4.5.9001 (2021-08-25)

-   Updated the visualisation vignette to now include the code necessary to get `geom_flame()` to work with **`plotly`** now that it is no longer directly supported

-   Pushing to GitHub actions now triggers codecov correctly

# heatwaveR 0.4.4.9005 (2020-12-22)

-   `exceedance` now outputs a one row all NA data.frame when there are no events in exceedance of the threshold
-   The previous version would return an error if no exceedances were detected, making it generally unusable in gridded data
-   All **`plotly`** dependencies were removed due to the orphaning of the package
    - The code to allow `geom_flame` to work with **`plotly`** may be found here: https://github.com/robwschlegel/MHWapp/blob/master/shiny/functions.R

# heatwaveR 0.4.4.9004 (2020-12-16)

-   Moved away from Travis CI to GitHub actions 

# heatwaveR 0.4.4.9004 (2020-11-18)

-   Fixed bug in `proto_event` that caused `joinAcrossGaps` argument to flag the first n days of a time series as part of an event

# heatwaveR 0.4.4.9000 (2020-07-30)

-   dplyr v1.0.0 no longer handles empty data.frames the same

    -   It now forces them to logical type, so empty data.frames no longer unnest with normal results
    -   This was fixed by having `detect_event` and `category` return single row NA data.frames instead

-   Thinking about phasing out **`data.table`**

# heatwaveR 0.4.4 (2020-06-27)

-   Released v0.4.4 to CRAN

-   Added one small test to get codecov back up to 100%

# heatwaveR 0.4.2.9001 (2020-01-08)

-   Beginning to phase out **`dplyr`** and **`tibble`** dependencies
-   Replacing some **`dplyr`** functions with **`plyr`** as they appear to be slightly faster and also don't have the same multicore issues that more recent **`dplyr`** developments have created
-   Added `roundRes` argument to `detect_event()` to allow users to decide the rounding precision of the returned results

# heatwaveR 0.4.2 (2019-12-10)

-   Minor change to `ts2clm()` that does not alter any functionality

# heatwaveR 0.4.2 (2019-11-29)

-   Publishing new stable version to CRAN due to removal of **`tidyverse`** from the list of suggested packages and the important bug fixes to `category()`

# heatwaveR 0.4.2 (2019-11-26)

-   Fixed bug in `category()` that incorrectly returned the difference between `seas` and `thresh` as the daily intensity value, rather than the actual temperature anomaly above `seas`

    -   Also fixed the labelling of days below `thresh` as `Moderate`, they are now `NA`

-   `category()` now adds lower case letters to the ends of event names if there were multiple large events within the same year

    -   This may cause backwards compatibility issues in very rare cases, but is a necessary change

-   Added `roundVal` argument to `category()` to allow users to decide the rounding precision of the returned results

# heatwaveR 0.4.1.9004 (2019-11-23)

-   Tripled the resolution of the logo in anticipation of creating hex stickers

# heatwaveR 0.4.1.9004 (2019-11-19)

-   Removed **`tidyverse`** from the list of suggested packages

# heatwaveR 0.4.1.9003 (2019-11-03)

-   The potentially backward compatibility breaking design change to have empty data.frames returned as one row of `NA` values was not as rare of a problem as first thought
-   While still respecting the need to not use `1:n` vector creation, `detect_event()` and `category()` now produce empty data.frames and not one row `NA` dataframe
-   This should ensure continued backwards compatibility

# heatwaveR 0.4.1.9002 (2019-11-03)

-   A bug was discovered where the `ts2clm()` function does not first check that the time series being fed to it is in correct chronological order

    -   This was fixed by ordering the data being fed to the function before beginning of the further calculations

# heatwaveR 0.4.1.9001 (2019-10-30)

-   An update to `data.table` sometime in August, 2019 reduced the packages tolerance for code with `1:n` in it

    -   As this is a potential memory weakness, when this creates an empty vector in multicore calculations it causes the entire run to fall over
    -   Therefore, all use of `1:n` has been replaced with `seq_len(n)`
    -   This changed the list outputs when no MHWs are detected to be one row of NA values, rather than an empty list
    -   This may cause backward compatibility issues, but is extremely unlikely

# heatwaveR 0.4.1.9000 (2019-10-26)

-   An update to the `ggplot2` package some time back in August, 2019 changed slightly how Geoms work internally

    -   This allowed `geom_lolli()` to fall over in very rare circumstances so this issue has been addressed

# heatwaveR 0.4.1 (2019-09-09)

-   Updated the `OISST Preparation` vignette to match the improvements to the `rerddap` package

-   Also updated the vignette to be more clear to contact NOAA about data retrieval issues

-   Added `season` argument to `category()`, which allows the user to specify which season of the MHWs they are interested in:

    -   'range' - The beginning and ending season of the MHW
    -   'start' - The season during the start of the MHW
    -   'peak' - The season during the peak of the MHW
    -   'end' - The season during the end of the MHW

# heatwaveR 0.4.0.9000 (2019-07-22)

-   Updated NOAA OISST data downloading tutorial to account for minor changes to NOAA ERDDAP servers

-   These additions also propagate through to `geom2trace.GeomFlame`

# heatwaveR 0.3.6.9001 (2019-01-28)

-   Added some additional options to `event_line()` to allow users to manipulate the output more without having to get into the source code.

# heatwaveR 0.3.6.9000 (2019-01-23)

-   Added S3 object `geom2trace.GeomFlame` that now allows `geom_flame()` to be converted to an interactive plotly object via `plotly::ggplotly()`

# heatwaveR 0.3.6 (2019-01-16)

-   Updated Zenodo badge to reflect the upload of v0.3.6

-   Finished Alternative Thresholds (Complex Climatologies) vignette

-   Bumped code coverage back up to 100%

-   Fixed bug in `ts2clm()` that prevented calculation of clims with large contiguous missing periods of data (e.g. ice coverage).
-   Added argument to `category()` that allows one to have the function also output the day-to-day (long) category values, rather than just the summary (wide) output.
-   Added lon/lat values to documentation for built-in time series

# heatwaveR 0.2.6.9001 (2018-05-24)

-   Moved all vignettes relating to the upcoming MHW_detection paper to that repo
-   This helps to unclutter this repo as it should be primarily kept for package content

# heatwaveR 0.2.6.9000 (2018-05-23)

-   Added vignette that shows how tweaking arguments for detect changes the outputs between languages and how those outputs may differ
-   Changed output of `detect_event` to better match Python version
-   Corrections to testthat to match changes to `detect_event` output

# heatwaveR 0.2.5.9003 (2018-05-22)

-   Added C++ function, `clim_calc_ccp()` for faster climatology calculations; speed of climatology calculation comes down from 50.6 ms in R to 3.4 ms in C++ on my MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2017) 2.9 GHz Intel Core i7 16 GB RAM computer

# heatwaveR 0.2.4.9003 (2018-05-21)

-   Updated testthat for `lolli_plot()` and `event_line()`
-   Updated testthat for `ts2clm()`
-   Updated testthat for `detect_event()`

# heatwaveR 0.2.4.9002 (2018-05-17)

-   Take advantage of C++ speed enhancement in `smooth_percentile()` by using RcppRoll
-   Update testthat accordingly

# heatwaveR 0.2.3.9002 (2018-05-17)

-   Basic R vs Python vignette finished

# heatwaveR 0.2.3.9001 (2018-05-16)

-   Minor fix to testthat
-   codecov up to 100%
-   Fix to `geom_lolli()` n argument
-   Fix to `lolli_plot()` y-axis range
-   Minor fix to `make_whole()`
-   Skeleton of R vs Python vignette added

# heatwaveR 0.2.3.9000 (2018-05-16)

-   Major speed-up in the climatology creation function. `clim_spread()` now returns a matrix, not a data frame. This makes the loop in `clim_calc()` much faster. In testing with the sst_WA data, it leads to a 3.7 fold speed improvement (520 ms down to 140 ms).
-   Speed-up of `make_whole()` (60 ms down to 40 ms)

# heatwaveR 0.2.2.9000 (2018-05-15)

-   Removed all instances of `detect()` in favour of the new pipeline
-   Updated `exceedance()` to utilise the internal functions
-   Updated object names in `block_average()`

# heatwaveR 0.2.1.9001 (2018-05-15)

-   Micro edits to documentation
-   Testing for all exported and internal functions brought up to speed
-   Ensuring that new `ts2clm()` and `detect_event()` pipeline returns the same results as the old `make_whole()` and `detect()` pipeline

# heatwaveR 0.2.1.9000 (2018-05-14)

-   Phasing in identical names as in the python version
-   `detect_event()` now passing checks
-   Must still test for MCSs
-   The old `detect()` function was unpacked and simplified. Internal code is now in new functions, most of which will not be seen by the user. They are `make_whole()` `proto_event()`, `clim_calc()`, `smooth_percentile()`, `clim_spread()`, and `ts2clm()`
-   `ts2clm()` used instead of `detect_clim()`
-   Climatologies can now be calculated independently of the detect functionality
-   `exceedance()` function testthat checks updated to account for change in variable naming

# heatwaveR 0.2.0.9000 (2018-05-11)

-   `detect()` has now been broken into `detect_clim()` and `detect_event()`
-   These now also rely on internal functions
-   The purpose of this is to create a family of functions that provide different options
-   New vignette on making short climatologies.

# heatwaveR 0.1.0.9000 (2018-05-10)

-   One may now provide alternative baselines and climatologies to `detect()`

# heatwaveR 0.0.7.9001 (2018-05-05)

-   Testing for `category()`
-   Testing for `block_average()`
-   Testing for `detect()`
-   Testing `exceedance()`
-   Removed default `threshold` for `exceedance()`
-   Tweaks to `exceedance()` error messages
-   Testing for `event_line()`
-   Testing for `lolli_plot()`
-   Tweaks to `lolli_plot()` error messages

# heatwaveR 0.0.7.9000 (2018-05-04)

-   New `category()` function returns the category results for events
-   Still requires testing and improved event naming scheme

# heatwaveR 0.0.6.9000 (2018-05-03)

-   Minor touch up to examples in `geoms.R`
-   First draft of `heatwaveR` hex logo added to site

-   Simplifications and consistency checks to `detect()`
-   Some writing on Baselines and climatology vignette

# heatwaveR 0.0.5.9001 (2018-05-02)

-   Fix to `event_line()` not plotting MCSs correctly
-   Fix error with smooth_percentile and smooth_percentile_width descriptions that were interchanged in `detect()`
-   Simplify initial lines of leap year calculations (remove redundant code)
-   change from `raster::quantile()` to `stats::quantile()`

# heatwaveR 0.0.5.9000 (2018-04-29)

-   Add option to use a custom baseline to `detect()` as requested by Maxime Marin (), The University of Tasmania (IMAS) -- CSIRO (O&A), and which is present in the python version of the package
