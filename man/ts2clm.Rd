\usage{
ts2clm(
  data,
  x = t,
  y = temp,
  climatologyPeriod,
  maxPadLength = FALSE,
  windowHalfWidth = 5,
  pctile = 90,
  smoothPercentile = TRUE,
  smoothPercentileWidth = 31,
  clmOnly = FALSE,
  var = FALSE,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame with two columns. In the default setting (i.e. omitting
the arguments \code{x} and \code{y}; see immediately below), the data set is
expected to have the headers \code{t} and \code{temp}. The \code{t} column is a
vector of dates of class \code{Date}, while \code{temp} is the measured variable
(by default it is assumed to be temperature).}

\item{x}{This column is expected to contain a vector of dates. If a column
headed \code{t} is present in the dataframe, this argument may be omitted;
otherwise, specify the name of the column with dates here.}

\item{y}{This is a column containing the measurement variable. If the column
name differs from the default (i.e. \code{temp}), specify the name here.}

\item{climatologyPeriod}{Required. To this argument should be passed two values
(see example below). The first value should be the chosen date for the start of
the climatology period, and the second value the end date of said period. This
chosen period (preferably 30 years in length) is then used to calculate the
seasonal cycle and the extreme value threshold.}

\item{maxPadLength}{Specifies the maximum length of days over which to
interpolate (pad) missing data (specified as \code{NA}) in the input
temperature time series; i.e., any consecutive blocks of NAs with length
greater than \code{maxPadLength} will be left as \code{NA}. The default is
\code{FALSE}. Set as an integer to interpolate. Setting \code{maxPadLength}
to \code{TRUE} will return an error.}

\item{windowHalfWidth}{Width of sliding window about day-of-year (to one
side of the center day-of-year) used for the pooling of values and
calculation of climatology and threshold percentile. Default is \code{5}
days, which gives a window width of 11 days centred on the 6th day of the
series of 11 days.}

\item{pctile}{Threshold percentile (\%) for detection of events (MHWs).
Default is \code{90}th percentile. Should the intent be to use these
threshold data for MCSs, set \code{pctile = 10}. Or some other low value.}

\item{smoothPercentile}{Boolean switch selecting whether to smooth the
climatology and threshold percentile time series with a moving average of
\code{smoothPercentileWidth}. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{smoothPercentileWidth}{Full width of moving average window for smoothing
climatology and threshold. The default is \code{31} days.}

\item{clmOnly}{Choose to calculate and return only the climatologies.
The default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{var}{This argument has been introduced to allow the user to choose if
the variance of the seasonal signal per doy should be calculated. The default of
\code{FALSE} will prevent the calculation, potentially increasing speed of calculations
on gridded data and reducing the size of the output. The variance was initially
introduced as part of the standard output from Hobday et al. (2016), but few
researchers use it and so it is generally regarded now as unnecessary.}

\item{roundClm}{This argument allows the user to choose how many decimal places
the \code{seas} and \code{thresh} outputs will be rounded to. Default is 4. To
prevent rounding set \code{roundClm = FALSE}. This argument may only be given
numeric values or FALSE.}

\item{returnDF}{The default (\code{TRUE}) tells the function to return the results as
type \code{data.frame}. \code{FALSE} will return the results as a \code{data.table}.}
}
\value{
The function will return a tibble (see the \code{tidyverse}) with the
input time series and the newly calculated climatology. The climatology contains
the daily climatology and the threshold for calculating MHWs. The software was
designed for creating climatologies of daily temperatures, and the units
specified below reflect that intended purpose. However, various other kinds
of climatologies may be created, and if that is the case, the appropriate
units need to be determined by the user.
  \item{doy}{Julian day (day-of-year). For non-leap years it runs 1...59 and
  61...366, while leap years run 1...366.}
  \item{t}{The date vector in the original time series supplied in \code{data}. If
  an alternate column was provided to the \code{x} argument, that name will rather
  be used for this column.}
  \item{temp}{The measurement vector as per the the original \code{data} supplied
  to the function. If a different column was given to the \code{y} argument that
  will be shown here.}
  \item{seas}{Daily climatological cycle [deg. C].}
  \item{thresh}{Daily varying threshold (e.g., 90th
  percentile) [deg. C]. This is used in \code{\link{detect_event}} for the
  detection/calculation of events (MHWs).}
  \item{var}{Daily varying variance (standard deviation) [deg. C]. This
  column is not returned if \code{var = FALSE} (default).}
Should \code{clmOnly} be enabled, only the 365 or 366 day climatology will be
returned.
}
\description{
Creates a daily climatology from a time series of daily temperatures using a
user-specified sliding window for the mean and threshold calculation, followed
by an optional moving average smoother as used by Hobday et al. (2016).

\details{
\enumerate{
\item This function assumes that the input time series consists of continuous
daily values with few missing values. Time ranges which start and end
part-way through the calendar year are supported.
\item It is recommended that a period of at least 30 years is specified in
order to produce a climatology that smooths out any decadal thermal
periodicities that may be present. When calculated over at least 30 years of
data, such a climatology is called a 'climatological normal.' It is further
advised that full the start and end dates for the climatology period result
in full years, e.g. "1982-01-01" to "2011-12-31" or "1982-07-01" to
"2012-06-30"; if not, this may result in an unequal weighting of data
belonging with certain months within a time series. A daily climatology will
be created; that is, the climatology will be comprised of one mean
temperature for each day of the year (365 or 366 days, depending on how
leap years are dealt with), and the mean will be based on a sample size that
is a function of the length of time determined by the start and end values
given to \code{climatologyPeriod} and the width of the sliding window
specified in \code{windowHalfWidth}.
\item This function supports leap years. This is done by ignoring Feb 29s
for the initial calculation of the climatology and threshold. The values
for Feb 29 are then linearly interpolated from the values for Feb 28 and
Mar 1.
\item Previous versions of \code{ts2clm()} tested to see if some rows are
duplicated, or if replicate temperature readings are present per day, but
this has now been disabled. Should the user be concerned about such repeated
measurements, we suggest that the necessary checks and fixes are implemented
prior to feeding the time series to \code{ts2clm()}.

The original Python algorithm was written by Eric Oliver, Institute for
Marine and Antarctic Studies, University of Tasmania, Feb 2015, and is
documented by Hobday et al. (2016).
